			Hey there,
		</h1>
		<p>
			My name is <b><ph style="color: blue;">Daniel Heinrich</ph></b>, and I'm very excited to welcome you to my website.  Fashioning myself off the proverbial renaissance man, I think of myself as a <b><ph style="color: yellow;">thinker</ph></b> and a <b><ph style="color: red;">tinkerer</ph></b>.
		</p>
		<p>
			Currently, I'm happily working as a Lead Technical Writer for the Analytics Cloud at Salesforce.  Helping millions of people analyze their business data is all in a day's work!
		</p>
		<p>
			My other pursuits include, but aren't limited to:
			<ul>
					<li>Web Development and Design</li>
					<li>Animation</li>
					<li>Music</li>
			</ul>
			Examples of each can be found right here where you already are. To see 'em, visit my portfolio.
		</p>
		<p>
			Have a look around my little corner of the Web.  Here you'll find my portfolio, full of both professional and amateur achievements.  And lots of unfinished projects. Unfinished projects are the best kind of projects.  ;)
		</p>
		<p>
			Thanks for visiting!
